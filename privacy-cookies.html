				<h2>Privacy &amp;amp: Cookies Policies</h2>
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is De Mort's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, <a href="http://www.demort.co.uk">http://www.demort.co.uk</a>, and other sites we own and operate.</p>
				<p>In short, we don't collect any personally identifiable information without your prior consent. We will only collect the information you provide via webforms on this website for the intended purposes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information submitted via our contact form or our email address is used to answer your enquiries. We don't automatically add you to any mailing lists for asking us a question.</li>
					<li>Information submitted via our newsletter signup form is used to send you marketing content for the explicit uses you select. You can unsubscribe at any time.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We only acquire your information for the purposes required, such as to respond to your enquiry or process an order. If you wish to amend, view or delete any data we hold on you, please contact us at dpo@demort.co.uk and we will respond as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Please note, we are legally obligated to keep a copy of any transactional data for HMRC accounts for up to seven years.</p>
				<h4>Third parties data control</h4>
				<p>We use several third party services to manage and host this website and connected services. As we do not have direct control over these services or sites, including our Etsy Shop, please refer to the privacy policies of these third parties for how they process and hold the information you submit.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Where your submitted information is stored&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We use Netlify for our website hosting and contact form. Any information submitted via our contact form is securely held in a database on Netlify's servers and is used by us to process your enquiry only. This database in not publicly accessible and your information can be removed from it at your written request.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>On each submission of our website contact form, we use Netlify to send an email notification, including a copy of the data you submit, to our company email address, provided and hosted Zoho. This makes it easier to manage enquiries by responding directly to your email. This information can be deleted at your request.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We use Zoho to manage and host all company email addresses @demort.co.uk. Any information you provide via our website contact form or our company email address is securely stored on Zoho's servers, and can be deleted at your request.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>We use Mailchimp for our email marketing services. This is an opt-in only service - you will not receive any marketing emails from De Mort without prior consent i.e. by submitting information via our newsletter signup form. If you choose to subscribe to our marketing list, your information is securely held on Mailchimp's servers. You can unsubscribe at any time by following the link provided in every marketing email or by contacting us to do this manually.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Financial information&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Currently, we sell stocked products through our Etsy shop. The products shown on this website www.demort.co.uk provide a link to purchase directly through Etsy - you are not able to add to a basket or checkout via our website.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As such, we are not a data controller for financial transactions that involve or use your data. We do not request any bank, debit or credit card information via our website - the only way this information will be entered into our third party systems is if you provide it in an enquiry via our contact form or email address. If you do this, it is at your own risk, and we would request that you use a third party data controller such as PayPal instead.</p>
				<p>If you wish to commission a unique work (original or reprint of previous work), no financial transactions will take place via this website.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we&rsquo;re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
				<p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we&rsquo;ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
				<p>We don&rsquo;t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.</p>
				<p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
				<p>You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.</p>
				<p>Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.</p>
				<p>This policy is effective as of 1 December 2019.</p>
