				<h4>Third parties data control</h4>
				<p>We use several third party services to manage and host this website and connected services. As we do not have direct control over these services or sites, including our Etsy Shop, please refer to the privacy policies of these third parties for how they process and hold the information you submit.&nbsp;</p>
				<h4>Where your submitted information is stored&nbsp;</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>We use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for our website hosting and contact form. Any information submitted via our contact form is securely held in a database on Netlify's servers and is used by us to process your enquiry only. This database in not publicly accessible and your information can be removed from it at your written request.</li>
					<li>On each submission of our website contact form, we use Netlify to send an email notification, including a copy of the data you submit, to our company email address, provided and hosted by Zoho. This makes it easier to manage enquiries by responding directly to your email. This information can be deleted at your request.</li>
					<li>We use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> to manage and host all company email addresses @demort.co.uk. Any information you provide via our website contact form or our company email address is securely stored on Zoho's servers, and can be deleted at your request.</li>
					<li>We use <a target="_blank" href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> for our email marketing services. This is an opt-in only service - you will not receive any marketing emails from De Mort without prior consent i.e. by submitting information via our newsletter signup form. If you choose to subscribe to our marketing list, your information is securely held on Mailchimp's servers. You can unsubscribe at any time by following the link provided in every marketing email or by contacting us to do this manually.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Financial information&nbsp;</h4>
				<p>Currently, we sell stocked products through our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> shop. The products shown on this website www.demort.co.uk provide a link to purchase directly through Etsy - you are not able to add to a basket or checkout via our website.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As such, we are not a data controller for financial transactions that involve or use your data. We do not request any bank, debit or credit card information via our website - the only way this information will be entered into our third party systems is if you provide it in an enquiry via our contact form or email address. If you do this, it is at your own risk, and we would request that you use a third party data controller such as PayPal instead.</p>
				<p>If you wish to commission a unique work (original or reprint of previous work), no financial transactions will take place via this website.&nbsp;</p>
				<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				<p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we&rsquo;re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
				<p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we&rsquo;ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>
				<p>We don&rsquo;t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.</p>
				<p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
				<p>You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.</p>
				<p>Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.</p>
				<p>This policy is effective as of 1 December 2019.</p>
				<h3>Cookies policy</h3>
				<h4>What are cookies?&nbsp;</h4>
				<p>A cookie is a small text file stored on your computer that helps provide functionality to a website. It could be to help storing a shopping basket, or to help you manage logging into your online account.</p>
				<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Some websites rely heavily on cookies for their functionality. This website www.demort.co.uk does not use cookies for anything other than monitoring website usage.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<h4>Cookies used on this website</h4>
				<p>We use the Google Analytics platform to provide us with anonymous website usage statistics. This industry standard tool helps us to manage our website more effectively by identifying potential technical issues (like broken pages or links) or improving the website content.</p>
				<p>When you browse our website, Google Analytics uses cookies to log your visit and information about your browser/device.</p>
				<p>None of the information logged by Google Analytics is personally identifiable to you or your device. The data is collated together to analyse browsing trends, rather than your individual behavior.&nbsp;</p>
				<h4>Why this is useful to us</h4>
				<p>Modern websites have to cater to a wide range of users, including some with accessibility issues. By logging the pages visited and technologies used to do so, we can spot potential problems or improvements to the website that benefit everyone. This could be making sure that all text is readable on a small mobile screen, or that images aren't stretched on a laptop.</p>
				<p>As we are a small business, the data can also help us identify which designs are popular and may be worth developing as products, or which type of events are popular and would be worth us attending.</p>
				<p>These are just examples and the use of analytics is not limited to these.</p>
				<h4>How to opt out of Google Analytics</h4>
				<p>You can disable cookies via your browser. Please note this should be done on a site-by-site basis to not break important functionality on other sites.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This policy is effective as of 1 December 2019.</p>
